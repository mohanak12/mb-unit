MSTest Adapter Plugin
====================

This plugin uses the MSTest test runner to adapt MSTest tests so that
they can run within Gallio and be manipulated by Gallio-based tools.

The plugin assembly is deliberately NOT signed using a strong name.
You can replace the underlying test framework with newer versions as
long as they are binary compatible with the originally distributed version.
