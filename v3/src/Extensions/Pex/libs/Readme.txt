Microsoft Pex libraries
=======================

These libraries are the minimum required to compile the Pex integration
projects.  They are insufficient to actually run Pex.

Pex must still be installed in order for it to work.

This was done on purpose.  Microsoft wishes to be able to track installations
of Pex so they have requested that we DO NOT redistribute Pex in its entirety.
