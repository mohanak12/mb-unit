    /// similar to System.Reflection but intended to enable reflection of .Net code
    /// assets that are not loaded as executable assemblies.  The reflection Api
    /// provides several capabilities not present in System.Reflection including the
    /// ability to obtain source file and line number information as well as Xml
    /// documentation comments.  This namespace includes a wrapper for standard .Net
    /// reflection and for a file-based reflection policy based on Mono.Cecil.
