    /// We must avoid copying these assemblies because it is possible for multiple copies
    /// to be loaded in the same process simultaneously in different load context (Load / LoadFrom / LoadFile).
    /// When multiple copies of the same assembly are loaded their types are considered distinct
    /// and they cannot reliably exchange information with other components (like plugins).

    /// in different locations were loaded at the same time.

    /// The Gallio loader may be used in situations where 3rd party integration mandates the
    /// installation of a Gallio-dependent assembly outside of the Gallio installation path.
    /// It is fairly typical for application plugin models.  
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// The loader itself will typically be loaded from the GAC or copy-local as usual.
    /// It will then springboard into the locally installed copy of Gallio which is found
    /// by searching the registry.  It is also possible to specify the location
    /// of the Gallio installation explicitly instead.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
