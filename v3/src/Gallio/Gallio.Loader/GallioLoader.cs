    /// The Gallio loader provides access to installed Gallio assemblies so that we can reference
    /// them even if they are not copied locally.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// We must avoid copying these assemblies because it is possible for multiple copies
    /// to be loaded in the same process simultaneously in different load context (Load / LoadFrom / LoadFile).
    /// When multiple copies of the same assembly are loaded their types are considered distinct
    /// and they cannot reliably exchange information with other components (like plugins).
    /// This problem was actually observed when two different Visual Studio add-ins installed
    /// in different locations were loaded at the same time.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// This type may be used in situations where 3rd party integration mandates the
    /// installation of a Gallio-dependent assembly outside of the Gallio installation path.
    /// It is fairly typical for application plugin models.  
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// When using this mechanism, one must ensure that no code will be accessed which
    /// depends on Gallio types until the resolver has been installed.  Thus it may be
    /// necessary to create "shims" at all external entry points into the system to ensure
    /// that the resolver is configured.  If the types contain fields that are Gallio types,
    /// these fields will need to be encapsulated.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// An alternative strategy for dealing with this assembly referencing problem would be to
    /// install the main Gallio assemblies in the GAC.  However, that can create its own
    /// share of problems because it is possible for both the GAC'd assembly and its non-GAC'd
    /// sibling assembly to the loaded at the same time.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// In sum, this is an awful hack, but a rather useful one given the absence of other
    /// acceptable workarounds.
    /// </para>
    /// <example>
    /// <para>
    /// To use the assembly resolver, create a configuration file for your application's
    /// primary assembly that specifies the path of the main Gallio assembly like this:
    /// </para>
    /// <code>
    /// <![CDATA[
    /// <configuration>
    ///   <gallio>
    ///     <installation>
    ///       <path>Absolute-path-to-Gallio-installation-folder-binaries</path>
    ///     </installation>
    ///   </gallio>
    /// </configuration>
    /// ]]>
    /// </code>
    /// <para>
    /// Then install the assembly resolver in your program BEFORE referencing any
    /// Gallio types.  Beware that types are referenced implicitly by field and
    /// method declarations.  So you may need to rearrange your code somewhat.
    /// </para>
    /// </example>
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    /// This hack should be replaced by a redistributable version-independent
    /// contract assembly someday.
