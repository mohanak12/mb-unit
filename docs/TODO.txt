* Eliminate the stupid underscore prefix on MbUnit._Framework.Tests
  that was needed to disambiguate between MbUnit v2 and v3 framework bits.
  Once we're self-hosting that becomes moot.

* Add support for test harness options passed in from the command-line.
  Such options can control how test frameworks perform enumeration, test
  execution, etc...
  Just plain vanilla string-based key/value pairs should suffice but
  we might want to allow test harness contributions to pass back descriptions
  of the parameters they can accept.

* When test enumeration fails for some reason, create templates or tests
  with special "Error" metadata to indicate the reason.  This way the test
  runner can still obtain the remainder of the tree.

* Add MSBuild and NAnt tasks for MbUnit.

* Someone on the newsgroups asked how to run a test repeatedly for a set period of time.
  This means that the number of tests is not known ahead of time and may change
  over the course of test execution.  Tricky.
  
  Would be interesting if the runner could handle dynamically created sub-tests
  somehow.  So the number of tests known to the runner would be fixed, but any of
  these tests could fork off someplace into as many dynamically generated tests
  as it needs and they will appear in the report as usual although perhaps decorated
  with an IsDynamic=true metadata entry or something.

  Launching new sub-tests could be handled by the context service perhaps.

* The Gallio framework is obviously incomplete.  Interim stuff needs to be
  heavily refactored, integrated and polished.

* HTML report XSLT needs to be redone for Gallio.

* TestSequence should be deprecated in favor of Test(Order = n)
